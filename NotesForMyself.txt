Notes for self!

I wrote this so that i know what to do next as this project is too big for me to remember it all

Logger (logger.hpp):

    This header contains no class but it contains the Initialization and error handling
    of SPDLOG logger, the pointer "LOG_INTO" that is contained in logger:: namespace 
    writes information to logs/logs.texture

Background_Class (background.hpp):

    This Class is now a template and modular, it takes the image path as an argument
    and passes it to it's member function setup_background()

    Things to add:
        (Done) - Function getter for the sprite variables

    don't touch this any further unless you will add animation for the background but that's just a problem for the future

Window_Class (window.hpp):

    This Class is not a template at all but a container so every event and updates happens
    from within the object class

    Things to change:

        - Add Proper Comments
        - Add more loggings

Texture_Class (texture.hpp):

    The main functionality of this class is to fetch spritesheets and animate them 
    and by also passing that as a texture for the entities (which is the rect variable "Rect_Class::rect") in Rect_Class

    Things to change:

        - Pls Add comments to this Class so that
          i don't forget how it works

Rect_Class (rect.hpp):

    This class is a template for creating new entities but take in mind that these entities that are
    created by this class has no texture and animation and that's when the Texture_Class comes in.

    I used sf::RectangleShape because it has a precoded hitboxes properties

    Things to Change:

        - Remove the movement function in the Rect_Class
        - Encapsulate the rect variable and use a getter function to draw that in the window
        - Put Loggers and comments in the class pls

Things to add:

    After fixing Rect_Class and some changes in Texture_Clas, combining these two make 
    by creating a Player_Class and from that make the samurai with it's proper texture 
    and animation based on it's movement direction

    don't worry about the health bar and hitboxes yet for now you should prioritize this
